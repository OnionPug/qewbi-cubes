I’m going out exploring today!~ Figured I’d wipe the rust off, maybe find a new crown…
I’ll leave some notes here for me to read when I wake up in the morning so I know what to look out for specifically…

Flattening Traps : They follow me around everywhere… Every temple I’ve gone to has flattened me in some semblance, I can shimmy about a little, just not if enough force is applied

Ice Traps : Uncommon, but, apparent.. being frozen is appreciated in the hot months but I can’t really move, at all, as long as I have my crown with me I should be fine !

Heat Traps : They SUCK in the hot months… but, they at least relax my body, pop my joints.. (wait, I don’t have joints) Helpful for trying to slink about, not helpful for doing literally anything else

More Warnings :
Remember your crown IS your livelihood! Use it to reform yourself, silly, don’t let it sit pretty and look nice, or roll away, make sure you can get it and use it. 
Also, you’re still susceptible to a lot of things just because you’re made of putty effectively.. make sure you keep your limbs together, head on the shoulders, not the palm of your hand.. at least chase after it if it comes off.
Also try not to get dizzy, it’s hard enough to focus your reformation magic when flattened, being dizzy doesn’t help, at all.

I’ll write back when the heist is successful~ <3 "
